I'm a young game enthusiast studying ICT in Vietnam. While still learning the fundamentals, I'm passionate about bringing imaginative game worlds to life.

My journey began with small projects to explore different technologies-- a smart car application in OpenCV, a 2D Pong game in Unity, and an in-progress Space Invaders clone. Along the way, I'm improving my software skills in Unity, C#, Java and Python.

Creating fun and interactive experiences for players to enjoy is my main motivation. I aspire to become an indie game developer one day, crafting magical realms and memorable characters through my games.

I know the road will be long, but I'm ready to put in the work. With each project, no matter how small, I'll build on what I've learned and stretch my capabilities. My ultimate goal is to create games that both challenge and delight players, bringing a little joy and escapism into their lives.

This is just the beginning, and I'm excited to see how far my imagination and skills can take me on this journey toward sharing meaningful game worlds with the world.
